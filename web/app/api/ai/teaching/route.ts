 * Turns what a class actually got wrong into something a teacher can act on.

 * The split matters. The counts come from `class_topic_evidence`, a plain SQL
 * aggregate over recorded answers, so the numbers are not the model's to
 * invent. The model's whole job is reading them: which gaps are worth a
 * teacher's next ten minutes, and what to do about each one. Ask it to do
 * arithmetic and it will occasionally get the arithmetic wrong; ask it to
 * interpret arithmetic it was handed and it is doing the thing it is good at.
 *
 * The RPC is maintainer gated in the database, so this route does not repeat
 * that check in a second place where the two could drift apart. A member
 * calling it gets the RPC's own refusal.
