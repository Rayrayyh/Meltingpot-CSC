 * One request, one budget, split so that reading pictures can never cost a

 * Organizing with attachments makes several model calls: one per image, then
 * one to write the note. They used to run end to end with no shared clock and
 * a ten second function around them, so attaching a single image reliably ran
 * past the ceiling and the platform killed the invocation. Every fallback in
 * this file is written to survive a model failure, and none of them run when
 * the function is severed mid-call: the class just saw the contribution fail.
 *
 * So the whole request gets a budget under maxDuration, and reading the images
 * may only spend part of it. Whatever is left belongs to writing the note,
 * which is the part that has to succeed. Captions are enrichment; if there is
 * no time for them the note is organized without them and says so.

 * the function carried on and saved the set. That is the "it failed but the
 * test is there" report: the work landed, the reply did not.
 *
 * 26 is the most a synchronous Netlify function is allowed. The mixing budget
