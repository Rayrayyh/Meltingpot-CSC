        <h2>What we collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Your email address and display name, to run your account.</li>
          <li>The notes, attachments, and corrections you write.</li>
          <li>Which classes you belong to and your role in them.</li>
          <li>
            A private record of the days you contributed, shown only to you.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you connect Google Classroom or Canvas: the account name it
            reports, your course list, and what those courses publish.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There are no advertising trackers and no analytics scripts. Cookies
          are used for two things: keeping you signed in, and remembering your
          time zone so the days on your private record are counted where you
          are.

        <h2>Who can see your work</h2>
        <p>
          Drafts are private to you. Nobody, including class maintainers, can
          read a note you have not shared. When you share a note, the members
          of that class can read it, and your name appears on it. Your record of
          days is never shown to anyone else. Where you stand in a class is
          worked out on the server from the class as a whole and shown only to
          you.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>The organizer and AI</h2>
        <p>
          When you ask MeltingPot to organize a note or build study material,
          the text of that note, and any images attached to it, are sent to
          Google&apos;s model API to produce the organized version. We do not
          use your notes to train models. When no model is configured, a
          deterministic organizer runs instead and your note leaves the
          database for nowhere.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Connected classes</h2>
        <p>
          Connecting Google Classroom or Canvas is optional. When you do,
          MeltingPot reads the courses you belong to and what they publish:
          assignments, due dates, announcements, and links to materials. It
          reads only. Nothing you do here is sent back to the school, and
          no grade, submission, or roster is read. Files in Google Drive are
          never downloaded; a material is a link that opens where the
          teacher put it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The token that lets us read is stored encrypted in the database
          and is only ever used on our server. Disconnecting deletes that
          token and everything it brought in; notes you started from an
          assignment stay yours. While our Google integration is in
          Google&apos;s testing status, a connection lapses after seven days
          and asks you to reconnect. A course a class maintainer links to a
          Pot is visible to every member of that Pot; a course you keep in
          your own calendar is visible to you alone.
        </p>

        <h2>Where it lives</h2>
        <p>
          Data is stored in Supabase, which runs on managed cloud
          infrastructure. Every table is protected by row level security, so
          the database itself enforces who can read what, and accounts that
          maintain classes can turn on two-step sign in.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Deletion</h2>
        <p>
          Removing a shared note in a class marks it removed rather than
          destroying it, so a mistaken removal can be undone by a maintainer.
          If you want your account or your content permanently deleted, ask
          through the repository below and we will do it.
