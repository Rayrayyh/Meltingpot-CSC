/**
 * What a downloaded attachment is allowed to claim about itself.
 *
 * The storage bucket only ever checked the MIME type the uploader declared,
 * and the file name on the attachments row is caller-controlled and goes
 * straight into Content-Disposition. Together that let someone upload
 * executable bytes while declaring application/pdf, name the row
 * "LectureNotes.exe", share it, and offer the class a trusted-looking
 * download. Uploads go from the browser to Storage directly, so there is no
 * server hop to validate on: the download route is the choke point every
 * viewer passes through, and it is where this runs.
 *
 * This narrows the hole rather than closing it. Verifying that the bytes match
 * the claim stops the disguise, but it is not malware scanning: a real PDF
 * that happens to be malicious still downloads as a PDF.
