# Memory

This directory is the project's knowledge base. It makes the repo, not chat history, the durable memory across build sessions.

## Rules

- One lesson or decision per file, with a one-line summary as the first line after the title.
- Record corrections and confirmed approaches alike, and always say why they mattered.
- Do not save what the repo or chat history already records. Specs live in `docs/SPEC.md`; the plan lives in `docs/PLAN.md`. Memory holds the things those files do not: decisions with their reasoning, and lessons learned the hard way.
- Update an existing note rather than creating a duplicate.
- Delete notes that turn out to be wrong.
- File naming: `NNN-short-slug.md`, numbered in creation order. Numbers are never reused after deletion.

## Layout

- `decisions/` - choices that were made, by whom, and why. Read these before changing architecture, scope, or design direction.
- `lessons/` - things learned during the build (environment quirks, failed approaches, confirmed techniques). Read these before debugging something that feels environment-shaped.

## Index

### Decisions
- 001 Source of truth precedence: SPEC.md wins; repo PDFs are historical
- 002 Stack and hosting: Next.js + Supabase (RLS on) + Netlify, Framer Motion/GSAP
- 003 AI organizer: deterministic implementation now, provider interface for a real model later
- 004 Auth and join flow: Supabase Auth, join-before-signup with pending membership, privileged ops server-side
- 005 Dashboard-first and brand: role-based dashboard, landing secondary, Phosphor icons, light + dark, clean production, one deploy
- 006 Process directives: fully autonomous long runs, frontend-design skill, iterate with bug and visual passes, log everything in the repo
- 007 body_text joins blocks with newlines so correction selections never span blocks
- 008 Production deployment: meltingpot-io.netlify.app, web/ as package root, Next runtime plugin required for zip deploys, clean database
- 009 Rate limiting and endpoint closure in the database: fixed-window limits sized for classroom NAT, anon locked to two RPCs, authenticated keeps only used write verbs
- 010 Orange brand rework: cream paper, orange primary, pot-and-m mark, Fraunces display, pill buttons; supersedes the green palette
- 011 Account surface and two-step sign in: profile at the foot of the nav, theme and security in /me/settings, enrolment paired with a real login challenge, landing open to signed-in people, mark with no tile
- 012 Google sign in on Supabase Auth rather than Firebase (asked for, declined with reasons), gated behind an env flag; contributor activity on the Pot home; restrained landing motion
- 013 Auth seam in lib/auth: Google OAuth removed, provider selection by env, Clerk slot present and unimplemented, one marked exception in proxy.ts

- 023 A demo Pot and a guided walkthrough for brand new accounts (idea, not built)
- 024 The landing hero shows the product: cropped tilted Pot page mock replaces the illustration
- 025 The landing scrolls natively: the Lenis wheel hijack removed after owner testing found it jittery
- 026 An outside scan set the header work, and the CSP ships permissive on purpose
- 027 Two interactions borrowed from other sites, translated rather than copied
- 028 Section two names the problem and opens three doors: demo Pot, class code, create a Pot
- 029 The sidebar folds on the kolejain curve, the Pots list slides across sidebars, the select, the notification hover and the scrollbar are drawn by the app
- 030 The record of days is quiet: the on-load modal is gone, the card carries the feature, days are cut where the reader is
- 031 The comparison rule is lifted: each person sees their own standing in a class, always said as what they are ahead of; no names, no list
- 032 The celebration returns as the stir, fired by the completion screens and never by a page load
- 033 Your sidebar lives in two private tables: favourites, last opened and order are owner-only rows, never columns on the roster
- 034 The caret is drawn on one line only: textareas keep the native caret, coloured, because a mirror is wrong a line at a time
- 035 The notification card collapses the way kolejain.com does: opacity in 0.1s, the rail does the rest
- 036 One pill slides between Original and Organized: two springs, leading edge first
- 038 Classwork from Canvas and Google Classroom: read-only import, who links decides who reads, tokens in Vault behind a server key, never a note until a person makes one
- 039 A bug pass fixes what it confirms, and names what it leaves: the 5 September pass, migration 0053, the two items deferred with reasons
- 040 The flashcard face is a printed card: the brand's card art on both faces, light ink in either theme, a paper veil under the words (superseded by 042)
- 041 Clerk groundwork, without switching: the seam's Clerk halves, Supabase third-party auth, current_uid() in front of every policy, all inert until the switch
- 042 The flashcard face is a color you choose: six colors in settings, peach by default, each measured against every ink on the face
- 041 Clerk groundwork, without switching: current_uid() in front of every policy (0054), the seam's Clerk halves built and inert, the switch and a domain left to the owner
### Lessons
- 001 Reading the spec PDFs in this container requires poppler, not pypdf
- 002 Next 16 conventions (proxy.ts, async params) and Playwright executablePath in this container
- 003 Supabase hosted defaults: confirmations on + mailer limit force RPC registration; default privileges grant new functions to anon
- 004 Browser TLS is blocked by the egress proxy here; dev routes browser Supabase calls through a Next rewrite
- 005 RLS is authorization, not a query filter; queries still filter user_id themselves
- 006 E2e suites reseed via guarded dev_reseed in global setup; lazily-created resources need in-flight guards
- 007 Re-check authorization at time of use: RPC membership guards, WITH CHECK on mutable columns, matching policy pairs, server-side staleness checks
- 013 A ledger trigger on delete fails its own foreign key inside the parent's cascade: 0045 made every Pot undeletable until 0048 taught the writer to skip a vanishing Pot
- 014 On Netlify's Next runtime a route handler does not know its own host: request.url and nextUrl carry the deploy permalink, so redirect relatively or from APP_ORIGIN
